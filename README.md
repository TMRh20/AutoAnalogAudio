**AutoAnalogAudio for Arduino by TMRh20 2016**

Automated analog reads and analog output (streaming) using Arduino DAC(or PWM), ADC and Timers

**New** Now also supports AVR devices (Uno,Nano,Mega,etc) with pseudo DAC using PWM

Plays and records analog (wav/pcm audio) data using onboard DAC and ADC. 
Timers are adjusted automatically based on the rate of data delivery, to ensure smooth playback.
